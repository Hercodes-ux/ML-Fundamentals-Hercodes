## 🌟 Featured Research Projects

### 🍿 1. Netflix-Scale Experimentation Suite (Statistical Inference)
**Goal:** Automate product deployment decisions by synthesizing Frequentist and Bayesian statistical methodologies.
- **Implementation:** Built a dual-inference engine in Python that calculates **Z-test p-values** alongside **Bayesian "Probability of Success"** using Beta Distributions.
- **Optimization:** Integrated **Power Analysis** to determine optimal sample sizes, mitigating the risk of Type II errors.
- **Folder:** `/Statistical_Inference`

### 🕵️‍♂️ 2. User Persona Discovery (Unsupervised Learning)
**Goal:** Discover hidden audience segments in unlabeled viewership data.
- **Heuristics:** Utilized the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm combined with the **Elbow Method (WCSS)** to mathematically determine the optimal cluster count for targeted marketing.
- **Feature Engineering:** Applied **StandardScaler** for Z-score normalization to ensure distance-metric integrity.
- **Folder:** `/Unsupervised_Learning`

### 📱 3. Smart-Device Price Predictor (Supervised Learning)
**Goal:** Automated categorization of mobile devices into Budget, Mid-Range, and Flagship tiers.
- **Algorithms:** Benchmarked Decision Trees against **Random Forest Ensembles** to reduce model variance.
