# Analytics-Engineering-Utilities

This repository contains a suite of professional-grade Python utilities designed to automate the Data Wrangling lifecycle.
Core Features:
Multi-Dimensional Aggregator: Leverages Pandas groupby and agg to generate comprehensive business summaries (Volume vs. Performance).
Cross-Tabulation Engine: Implements advanced pivot_table logic to uncover product-level performance across different regions.
Automated Feature Engineering: Uses lambda transformations to dynamically categorize data into performance tiers based on statistical medians.
Why this matters: In production environments, data is rarely in the correct format for analysis. I built this library to ensure that raw transactional data can be transformed into actionable business reports with sub-second latency.
